# FourierOpticsJHU2021

### Course requirements

#### Course structure:

   This course meets weekly. If you are taking this course for credit, 
   regular attendance and in-class participation is expected.  Unavoidable
   absences (such as observing runs) should be discussed with us beforehand.

   Inspired by 
   2001 BEC Nobel laureate [Carl Wieman](http://www.cwsei.ubc.ca/)'s work
   on improving STEM teaching, we use the "reading and homework first, lecture second" method.
   Feedback and comments are especially welcome as the class progresses,
   as this our trial run using Wieman's style of teaching.
   
#### Grade

  There will be no tests and no final exam for this course. Your grade for this
  course will be determined by equally weighted contributions from:

- Participation in the discussion of the problem sets attempted before class
- Turning in homework post-discussion
- Oral presentation and term paper


#### Problem sets and assigned reading - homework first, lecture second
#####  (We can change this for 2021 class - I just copied this section as well)

In the earlier part of the course we will assign problem sets and/or reading
that must be attempted and/or done ** before the next class **.
The goal of your reading is to acquiant you with the relevant ideas, framework,
vocabulary, and formalism.  The problems then give you an opportunity to try working
these before the lecture.

1. Attempt every problem before class. This prep work is essential for
   the ** in-class discussion amongst yourselves ** 
   during the first quarter of each class.
   Air your confusion or clarity on the concepts and details, and help each other.
   This discussion is a major vehicle of learning in the class.  
   
2. The professor(s) will listen to your discussion, and tailor the 
   lecture to areas that need more attention.

3. Complete your homework and turn it in by the start of the following class
   (email to ** jhu.fourieroptics@gmail.com ** or hardcopy).
   Before class ends we will assign the pre-class homework for the following class.

#### Term Paper and Oral Presentation:

  A term paper is required.  Topics will generally be taken from the
  historical/research literature on coronography, interferometry, and aperture
  synthesis in radio and optical astronomy.  You may suggest your own topic.
  ** The subject matter must be approved by Ron and Anand **.

  Topics will generally be chosen early in the class; first full drafts are due before
  the Thanksgiving break, and ought to be 4 - 5 pages long (single-spaced) plus
  figures. You may use any text processor/formatter you please, but if you have
  no preference you are encouraged to use LaTeX2e with a "class" file from one
  of the common astronomy journals (e.g. aastex.cls).

  A stand-up presentation on the topic of your term paper is required.
  You will have about 30 minutes to present and respond to questions 
  from the audience.
  Many students use PowerPoint (or an equivalent) for this.
  We will do this in early December.

  ** Start discussing topics as early as possible **

#####  Term paper milestones
+ Topic with suggested section titles
    - Due week of Class #4 (September nn).
	- What is the tie in to course matter? E.g., Appropriate survey/new ideas?
	- Potentially publishable? (start discussing early)
+ Rough draft 2-3 pages
    - Due October nn (week of Class #6)
	- Demonstrate relevance, feasibility
	- Almost final section definitions, section entries with substance/detailed plan
+ First full draft submission, 4-5 pages
	- Before Thanksgiving break
+ Final paper due at presentation

### Class Schedule
Weddays are used here - in the first scheduled class we decide on which day of the week we meet for 2h 30 min (with a short break in the middle)
I also used to get guest lectures from eg you, Marshall when neither Ron or I could make it.  Ron used me for that when he taught by himself.  I just left 2018's lecturers in the table as a placeholder but put in dates away.

	Subject: Teacher Course Evaluations are Now Available for Fall 2018 Term!
 
	Fall 2018 teacher course evaluations are now available for your students to complete online. They will receive an email asking them to complete a short 10-15 question survey for each of the following courses in which they are enrolled:
	
	- Any Arts & Sciences (AS) course section with a minimum enrollment of at least 5 undergraduate students. All AS independent study, research, and internship based courses are excluded regardless of the number of students enrolled.
	
	- Any Engineering (EN) course with a minimum enrollment of at least 5 students. All EN department seminar, independent study, research, and internship based courses are excluded regardless of the number of students enrolled.

	Each evaluation should take approximately 5-10 minutes to complete.
