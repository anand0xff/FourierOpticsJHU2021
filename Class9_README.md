### 171.755 Class 9: Anand.  Interferometry

#### Class 10 is CASA-centric!
Any CASA installation trouble?



####  Questions/discussion on term paper?

##### Clarifications:

**hcipy energy conservation**.  See my paste from Emiel Por on the slack channel 'general'

**What do plexiglass Ruffles potato chips have to do with optics?  Discuss**. 

---
**Autocorrelation theorem**.  *Proof*.  
Fourier joke - try this at home...  calculate convolution of f(x) and a delta function.  Then the cross correlation of a delta function with f(x).  They are short but very revealing pencil and paper exercises.


**Pupil to image field to image intensity to FT of image intensity**. 
The FT of image intensity (with any sky scene) is the  **complex visibility** (CV, or sometimes just V).  
The CV is 2D, complex, symmetric real part, antisymmetric imaginary part, and is the bread and butter of radio astronomy. *Ford_McKernal_etal png* 

The CV of a **point source** is called the **optical transfer function** of the telescope.  Its absolute value is the **modulation transfer function**.  Why? Circular, elliptical, multi-hole CV support.  Spatial frequency filter concept.

Think of sky scenes as made up of Fourier components.  What does a two-dish radio interferometer measure?  (Recap Laurent).

*nrmexplainmovie.mp4*  Stop at 1 hole, stop at 2 holes.  "DC theorem" and "zero spacing" in radio?  
*Wilnersequence* pdf 'movie' (orientation 'bug') - Synthetic imaging (technically it's not "aperture synthesis").
