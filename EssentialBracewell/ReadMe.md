## The most important figures in Bracewell's book

Bracewell's book arose from his Pictorial Dictionary of Fourier Transforms.

These are the figures in his 3rd Edition that compress the book into just a few pages.  The figure on symmetries, p15, has one mistake.  Can you spot it?

The last series of figures is several pages long - just the first page is reproduced here.
