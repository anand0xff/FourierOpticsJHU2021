### 171.755  Fourier Optics Class #1
###  Intro, requirements, class software, scalar field, far field

#### Soon after Class #1, and before Class #2, you need to have the following: 

- anaconda with python 3.8 on your laptop into a conda envirionment (I call mine py38)
- install astropy using conda
- Install [poppy](https://poppy-optics.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html).  We only use it's matrixDFT routine (see code/testMFT.py) to explore numerical transforms.
- Install [hcipy](https://github.com/ehpor/hcipy), which implements physical units in optics nicely (and more)
- Reading and writing FITS files (using astropy.io.fits)
- Familiarity with DS9, image display stretches (sqrt, linear, log,..) and e.g
  matplotlib's imshow and plotting, or equivalent.  samplePSF.fits provided.
- a github account and an accepted invitation to join this repo.

After class, finish the problem sets associated with the class and turn in a
pdf file of your work by emailing it to jhu.fourier@gmail.com

- **This address is only for the homework files**. For anything else,
contact Anand or Laurent by email, or in person.
- **We are unsure of how much time the assigned work will require**, so early feedback is welcome.
	
	

We will often assign problem sets and/or reading - 
attempt the problems and read the material **before the next class**.
The goal of your reading is to acquiant you with the relevant ideas, framework,
vocabulary, and formalism.  The problems then give you an opportunity to try working
these before the lecture.
