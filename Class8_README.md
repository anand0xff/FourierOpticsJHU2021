### 171.755 Class 6: Anand.  AO, Wavefront sensing, defocus, Shack-Hartmann, Missell-Gerchberg-Saxton, GSGS, Electric field conjugation


####  Questions/discussion on term paper?

#### Questions on Homework from Class 6:

**Pencil and paper**. To do this homework you will need some of the symmetry  properies of the transforms of real functions.  
Last week: show that the Fourier transform of a real function is Hermitian, and working on symmetry of FTs, application to first order speckles.  
Exercises in psf expansion symmetries, effects on morphology, and Strehl raatio

**Running and playing with code**    
- Single ripple -- increasing amplitude?  
- Two  ripples -  interaction?  Big ripples?  A zillion ripples?
**Discuss**. 

#### Look at README.md next few lectures - necessary homework

#### Class presentations/verbal descriptions of phase bump experiments 

#### Spatially filtered wavefront sensing (continued from class 7)

 - AO schematic
 - Shack Hartmann Wavefront Sensor (WFS) *{dictionary note}* Tokovinen fig
